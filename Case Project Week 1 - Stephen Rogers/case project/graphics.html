    <p>This video card has boosted my performance in games by a mile. My old GTX 970 couldn't even give me &frac13; the performance when gaming in 1440p.
        I would recommend this card to anyone who wants the best raw performance for their money in 1440p over the next few years.
        This card has never given me any issues.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, this graphics card has treated me extremely well, and I hope it keeps performing great for years to come.</p>
