    <h2>Samsung 970 Evo 500GB NVME SSD</h2>

    <h3>Cache: 512 MB</h3>

    <p>This SSD is EXTREMELY fast. It uses the M.2 connector on my motherboard, which allows it to achieve over 2500MB/s read and write speeds.
        Games and programs load really fast, but more importantly, I can boot into Windows in less than ten seconds. I also have other hard drives
        in my system, including a 1TB and a 3TB drive, but those are much less important.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, I absolutely love this SSD. It's a huge upgrade from physical disk drives, and it speeds up my workload a bunch.</p>
