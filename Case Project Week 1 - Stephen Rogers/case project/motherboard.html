    <h3>Form Factor: ATX</h3>
    <h3>Chipset: X570</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This motherboard is one of the cheaper X570 options. It is definitely a solid choice for an X570 motherboard without
        going over budget. The only problem I have had is that it doesn't include an onboard USB Type-C connector for my case.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, this motherboard has treated me great for the price.</p>
