    <p>This case looks really good, and was a breeze to build in. It has plenty of routes for cables, which allowed
        for a clean looking build. It came with 3 case fans pre-installed, which made for decent airflow through my system.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, I love this case because it looks good and gives you a lot for the price.</p>
