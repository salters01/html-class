    <p>This CPU Cooler has given me no problems. The temperatures are sub-par, usually keeping my CPU around 50-60&degC while idle.
        On the bright side, it doesn't go up much more while gaming or under load. This could be due to the CPU being from AMD,
        a company which isn't known to be efficient or run cool. Other than this, the radiator fan has been very quiet, which
        is nice.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, this cooler has treated me okay, I only wish the temperatures were at least slightly lower.</p>
