    <h1>Stephen's Computer</h1>
    <main>This website was created as a rundown of my computer's specification. This site goes over
        each part, the price for each part, and how each part performs.
    </main>
    <p>Each page will contain a picture of the part, along with a reference to where the picture
        was borrowed from. I also explain what I think about each part.
